            "NumPy is a powerful library for working with numerical data in Python. One of the primary features of NumPy is its `ndarray` (n-dimensional array) object, which is used to store and manipulate large arrays of homogenous data (i.e., data of the same type, such as integers or floating point values).\n",

            "The `as np` part of the statement creates an alias, so that we can refer to NumPy as `np` instead of typing out the full `numpy` each time.\n",
